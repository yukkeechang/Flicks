# MovieViewer
# Project 1 - *MovieViewer3*

**Name of your app** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to use the search function
2. Making images fade in when they load (basically both optional features)
